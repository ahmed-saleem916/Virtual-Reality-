# Virtual-Reality-

I focused on ensuring the graphs and the plotting was in order. When plotting and recieveing the data I ensured that I was able to clean and fix up the graphs. I also helped work on the worksheets in which we conducted the regressions on the scatter plot of finding the regression between 2018-2022 house value and crime rates of non violent and violent. 

I also worked on helping out with ensuring the data was clean as I helped separate the 4 years and also plot them individually using plotting formulas to make the graph look clean and presentable.
