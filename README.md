# Virtual-Reality-

## Viduls Branch:
I initially focused on cleaning and analyzing the San Francisco crime data, then switched to working with population data to get it into a usable format. I also worked on making graphics for our final presentation. 

### Crime Data: 
This work is contained in the [Crime Data](https://github.com/ahmed-saleem916/Virtual-Reality-/tree/Vidul/Crime%20Data) folder. This contains the work I did while examining the crime data initially but most of this information, other than the crime categories we defined, was not used in the final analysis. I am keeping these in my branch because I used some of the grouping methods, sorting strategies, and outputs later on my own when working with the population data as well as visualizing the crime data. 

### Population Data:
Once we realized we needed population data I pivoted to collecting population data from different sources online, primarily the [US Census Website](https://data.census.gov/). This data is in a folder labeled [Population Data](https://github.com/ahmed-saleem916/Virtual-Reality-/tree/Vidul/Population%20Data). Here I have all of my outputs of data in different formats. This includes the San Francisco Population for years 2018 through 2022, all of this information compiled together in the same dataframe/csv for ease of use, a CSV which shows which neighborhoods are in each zip codes which was critical for matching up housing data with population data and crime data, as well as the population of each neighborhood in each year for all of the years in our analysis. 

### Visualization:
I made two maps showing the distribution of violent and non violent crimes in San Francisco over the timeframe and placed the file and exported maps for this in the [SF Hood Crime Map](https://github.com/ahmed-saleem916/Virtual-Reality-/tree/Vidul/SF%20Hood%20Crime%20Map) folder. I did the mapping in QGIS which is a free to use geospatial analysis program that I felt more comfortable using than hvplot. We had trouble using hvplot earlier in our project and I felt that QGIS did a better job producing an output that was in the style we liked for the final presentation. I used my own crime and population data to make these plots.
