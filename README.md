## Group 2: Mary-Elizabeth Vogel, Vidul Dasan, Ariel Lin, Mirian Ruanova, Ahmed Saleem, Blaze Hickey

## Introduction: 
Our group is testing the **hypothesis:** A high crime rate for violent crime in San Francisco neighborhoods negatively affects the price of home values for a given neighborhood.

### Data We Used: 
We needed housing and crime data, and preferred free online resources for this. We got our housing data from Zillows online [Housing Data portal](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/), specifically the **Zillow Home Value Index**, and got our crime data from the [San Francisco Open Data Online Portal](https://datasf.org/opendata/). We used [Police Department Incident Reports: 2018 to Present](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783).
