# Virtual-Reality-

## Viduls Branch:
I initially focused on cleaning and analyzing the San Francisco crime data, which I included on my branch. This work is contained in the [Crime Data](https://github.com/ahmed-saleem916/Virtual-Reality-/tree/Vidul/Crime%20Data) folder. Once we realized we needed population data I pivoted to collecting population data from different sources online, primarily the [US Census Website](https://data.census.gov/). This data is in a folder labeled [Population Data](https://github.com/ahmed-saleem916/Virtual-Reality-/tree/Vidul/Population%20Data). I also had some scratch work when first examining the data, as well as checked some data frames and possible ways to join which I kept in the [Other Work](https://github.com/ahmed-saleem916/Virtual-Reality-/tree/Vidul/Other%20Work) folder.
